Web Developer Portfolio of Atrian Wagner

## about project

Created for Udacity Front End Development Nanodegree following:
- a defined rubric (not public)
- the [Udacity Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/)
- a suggested [design mockup](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a136147_design-mockup-portfolio/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf) meant to be a starting point

Since this project is meant to be showcasing projects I develop later in this program, I have used image placeholders and links suggested from the design mockup in the interim.

## project status

This is the first stage of this project, which is designed to meet the submission requirements. The later versions will include development work and a greater deviation from the suggested design mockup.

## design notes
